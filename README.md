it's my first try in creating reasonable and helpful tool
I like games and time to time trying myself in game development
Once again taking another js game library ( this time it became an PixiJS) 
I realize that development of more than 1 scene might turn into nightmare.
So my decision was  creating of wrapper ( later I named it pixi-framework as it has framework structure)
